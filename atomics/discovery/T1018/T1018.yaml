- name: Remote System Discovery - sweep
  description: |
    Identify remote systems via ping sweep.

    Upon successful execution, sh will perform a ping sweep on the 192.168.1.1/24 and echo via stdout if an IP is active. 

  supported_platforms:
    - linux
    - macos

  executor:
    name: sh
    elevation_required: false
    command: |
      for ip in $(seq 1 254); do ping -c 1 192.168.1.$ip; [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "192.168.1.$ip UP" || : ; done
      
- name: Remote System Discovery - nslookup
  description: |
    Powershell script that runs nslookup on cmd.exe against the local /24 network of the first network adaptor listed in ipconfig.

    Upon successful execution, powershell will identify the ip range (via ipconfig) and perform a for loop and execute nslookup against that IP range. Output will be via stdout. 

  supported_platforms:
    - windows
  executor:
    name: powershell
    elevation_required: true
    command: |
      $localip = ((ipconfig | findstr [0-9].\.)[0]).Split()[-1]
      $pieces = $localip.split(".")
      $firstOctet = $pieces[0]
      $secondOctet = $pieces[1]
      $thirdOctet = $pieces[2]
      foreach ($ip in 1..255 | % { "$firstOctet.$secondOctet.$thirdOctet.$_" } ) {cmd.exe /c nslookup $ip}
